# PB&J 

PB&J is an mouse interactive game, where the player will use the mouse to slide a piece of bread horizontally across the screen. The player will then press the 'SHIFT' key which causes a condiment to fall. With every press, 1-3 condiments will fall and the player will try to collect as much peanut butter, jelly, and bread, to create the tallest possible PB&J sandwich.
